TEAM ROLES 
### ðŸ”§ Backend Developer
A software developer does the actual job and codes an application. like an app features a front end and a back end, there are front-end and back-end developers.
Front-end developers create the part of an application that users interact with, ensuring that an app offers an equally smooth experience to allâ€”no matter the device, platform, or operational system.

Back-end developers, in turn, implement the core of an appâ€”its algorithms and business logic. Experienced back-end developers not only write code but also do the tasks of an architectâ€”for example, devise an app architecture or design and implement the necessary integrations.
In general, they are Responsible for designing and building API endpoints, managing server-side logic, creating database models, and ensuring secure and efficient data handling. They implement the core functionality of the application using Django and Django REST Framework.

###  Database Administrator (DBA)
Manages the structure and health of the MySQL database. They handle data modeling, indexing, optimization, and ensure secure data storage and retrieval.


###  QA Engineer
The job of a quality assurance engineer is to verify whether an application meets the requirementsâ€”both functional and non-functional. Functional requirements define what an application should do, while non-functional requirements specify how it should do that. To verify both, QA specialists run various checks, followed by analyzing the test results and reporting on the application quality.

They evaluate an application from different anglesâ€”be it functionality, usability, security, or performance (hence, many types of testing)
They Makes sure an application performs according to requirements

Spots functional and non-functional defects.


###  Project Manager
In sequential models, a project manager is responsible for distributing tasks across team members, planning work activities, and updating project status.

In Agile projects where the focus is on self-management, transparency, and shared ownership, a PM sets up the vision of a product, maintains transparency, fosters communication, searches for improvements in the development process, and makes sure a team delivers more value with each iteration.


###  DevOps engineer
Even in Agile environments, development and operations teams can be siloed. DevOps engineers serve as a link between the two teams, unifying and automating the software delivery process and helping strike a balance between introducing changes quickly and keeping an application stable. Working together with software developers, system administrators, and operational staff, DevOps engineers oversee and facilitate code releases on a CI/CD basis.



TECHNOLOGY STACK
 list of technologies used in the Airbnb Clone backend project and their purposes:

### Django
Python web framework that makes it easier to build secure and maintainable web applications. It handles routing, server-side logic, and integrates well with databases.

### Django REST Framework (DRF)
The process of building RESTful APIs. It allows for easy serialization, authentication, and CRUD operations.

### MySQL
Database used to store and manage application data such as user accounts, properties, bookings, payments, and reviews.

### GraphQL
A query language that provides a flexible and efficient way to request exactly the data needed from the backend. Useful for frontend integration.

### Celery
A distributed task queue used to run background jobs such as sending confirmation emails or processing delayed payments without slowing down the main app.

### Redis
An in-memory data store used for caching and managing asynchronous task queues. Helps improve performance by storing frequently accessed data temporarily.

###  Docker
A containerization platform that ensures the project runs consistently across different environments (your laptop, the cloud, etc.).

###  CI/CD Pipelines (GitHub Actions)
Used to automate testing, building, and deploying your code. This helps detect errors early and ensures that updates to the backend are smooth and reliable.

### Postman or Swagger (for API Testing)
Tools used to test your API endpoints during development. They help verify that routes like `/users/` or `/bookings/` work correctly.



Database Design
The database for the Airbnb Clone project follows a relational design. It includes core entities that represent users, properties, bookings, reviews, and payments. These entities are connected to reflect how real-world booking platforms work.

###  Users

- `id` (Primary Key)
- `username`
- `email`
- `password`
- `is_host` (Boolean to identify hosts)


###  Properties
Represents properties listed by hosts.

**Important Fields:**
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `title`
- `description`
- `location`
- `price_per_night`
- `owner_id` (Foreign Key to Users)


###  Bookings
Represents the reservation details made by users.

**Important Fields:**
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `user_id` (Foreign Key to Users)
- `property_id` (Foreign Key to Properties)
- `check_in_date`

Feature Breakdown
This section outlines the core features of the Airbnb Clone backend and their roles in providing a fully functional booking platform.

###  User Management
Handles user registration, login, authentication, and profile updates. It ensures that users can securely create accounts, manage their personal details, and differentiate between guests and hosts.

###  Property Management
Allows hosts to list, update, retrieve, and delete properties. This feature ensures that property data is well-structured and accessible, making it easy for users to browse available stays.

### Booking System
Enables users to book properties, check availability, and manage booking dates (check-in/check-out). This feature ensures that property availability is properly managed to avoid double bookings.

###  Payment Processing
Integrates a payment mechanism to handle transactions for bookings. It securely stores payment details and confirms successful transactions, contributing to a complete user journey.

###  Review System
Lets users leave feedback and ratings for properties they have stayed in. This adds credibility to the listings and helps future users make informed decisions based on reviews.

###  API Documentation
The backend is documented using the OpenAPI standard, allowing for clear and interactive REST API documentation. This helps developers understand how to use the system's endpoints.

###  API Security
Implements authentication, permissions, and data validation to protect user data and secure endpoints. This prevents unauthorized access and ensures safe interactions with the system.

###  CI/CD Pipelines
Automates code testing and deployment using tools like GitHub Actions. This improves development efficiency and reduces errors during updates and production releases.

###  Database Optimization
Uses techniques like indexing and caching (with Redis) to speed up data retrieval and reduce database load. This keeps the application fast and responsive under heavy usage.


API Security
Securing the backend API is critical for protecting user information, financial transactions, and platform integrity. Below are the key security measures implemented in this project:

###  Authentication
We will implement secure user authentication using token-based systems like JWT (JSON Web Tokens). This ensures that only registered and verified users can access protected routes, like booking a property or updating account details.

###  Authorization
Authorization checks ensure that users can only access resources they own or are permitted to use. For example, a user should not be able to delete another user's booking or property listing.

###  Rate Limiting
Rate limiting helps prevent abuse by limiting the number of requests a user can make in a given time period. This protects the API from denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and excessive usage from bots.

###  Input Validation & Sanitization
All incoming data will be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks such as SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This keeps the application and its data safe from malicious input.

###  Secure Payment Handling
Payment information will be handled through secure, PCI-compliant third-party providers. Sensitive data like credit card numbers will not be stored directly in our database to reduce the risk of breaches.

###  HTTPS and SSL
In production environments, all API communications will be served over HTTPS to encrypt data in transit and protect it from being intercepted.

###  Why Security Matters

- **User Data Protection**: Ensures personal data like emails, passwords, and profiles remain private and secure.
- **Platform Integrity**: Prevents unauthorized actions that could corrupt or disrupt the system (e.g., fake bookings, property spam).
- **Payment Security**: Protects sensitive financial data and builds trust with users.
- **Legal Compliance**: Helps meet data protection laws like GDPR by securing user information.


CI/CD Pipeline
CI/CD stands for **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Deployment/Delivery**. It is a set of practices that automatically test, build, and deploy your application whenever code is pushed to your repository. This ensures that new changes do not break existing features and that updates can be delivered to users quickly and reliably.

###  Why CI/CD is Important

- **Improves Code Quality**: Automatically runs tests to catch bugs before deployment.
- **Saves Time**: Reduces the need for manual testing and deployment.
- **Enhances Collaboration**: Ensures every team memberâ€™s code is tested and integrated properly.
- **Supports Agile Development**: Enables frequent updates with minimal downtime or risk.


###  Tools Used in This Project

- **GitHub Actions**: Automates testing and deployment when code is pushed to the repository.
- **Docker**: Ensures that the app runs in the same environment on all machines by using containers.
- **Docker Compose** *(optional)*: Manages multi-container Docker applications for local testing and deployment.
- **pytest/unittest**: Runs automated tests before deployment to ensure code reliability.
- **Heroku / Render / AWS / DigitalOcean** *(Optional deployment platforms)*: Hosts the live backend API with automatic deployments triggered by CI/CD tools.

This pipeline helps ensure that the Airbnb Clone backend is always reliable, tested, and production-ready.
